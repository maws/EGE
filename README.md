# Eruption Game Engine
An open source 3d game engine derived from previous versions of GeniEngine (an open souce 2d game engine framework).

## Info

This is the Eruption Game Engine development repository. It is buggy, unstable, and dirty until version 1.0 is built. EGE is a spiritual successor to the GeniEngine 2 game engine framework.

### Version 1.0 progress: **1.8%** (as of 06/09/2015)

## FAQ

* **Do you accept pull requests?**
When the project has passed the stage of basically a programmer playground, yes I will review pull requests. Until then, fork and build at your own risk! It may fail, hard.

* **Can I use the source from this repository?**
Yes you can. Howsoever I would like to be credited, it is not required.
