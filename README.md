## FAQ

* Do you accept pull requests?
When the project has passed the stage of basically a programmer playground, yes I will review pull requests. Until then, fork and build at your own risk! It may fail, hard.

* Can I use the source from this repository?
Howsoever I would like to be credited, it is not required.
